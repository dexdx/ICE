# What's ICE

ICE (Indirect Cointegration Estimation) is a new simple and indirect method for estimating cointegrating relationships in multivariate stochastic processes. The method exploits Johansen's benchmark representation of a cointegrated system (reduced VECM) to estimate the cointegrating matrix via a VAR estimation. Because of that, it is a *generic* approach in which any VAR estimator can be applied, and as a consequence, is also applicable in high dimensions and/or sparse settings by accordingly choosing a regularized estimator.
