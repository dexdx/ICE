# ICE

ICE (Indirect Cointegration Estimation) is a new general and indirect method for estimating cointegrating relationships in multivariate stochastic processes. The method exploits Johansen's benchmark representation of a cointegrated system (reduced VECM) to estimate the cointegration matrix via a VAR estimation.
